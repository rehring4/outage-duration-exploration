## Introduction

In this project, we studied power outages across the United States. We specifically were interested in anlyzing the duration of power outages and determining the factors that led to longer outages. With this we also had the goal of predicting how long an outage would be based on various factors including weather, location, cause and more.

## Assessment of Missingness

Here's what a Markdown table looks like. Note that the code for this table was generated _automatically_ from a DataFrame, using

```py
print(counts[['Quarter', 'Count']].head().to_markdown(index=False))
```

| Quarter     |   Count |
|:------------|--------:|
| Fall 2020   |       3 |
| Winter 2021 |       2 |
| Spring 2021 |       6 |
| Summer 2021 |       4 |
| Fall 2021   |      55 |
